## Step 1: Load packages

[Some useful packages are being loaded below. You can add any additional ones you might need too.]

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(knitr) # for kable table formating
library(haven) # import and export 'SPSS', 'Stata' and 'SAS' Files
library(readxl) # import excel files
library(CODreports) # custom report functions
```

## Step 2: Load data

```{r}
```

## Step 3: Tidy data

```{r}
```

## Step 4: Run analysis

### Pre-processing

[you can remove this section if no pre-processing is required]

```{r}
```

### Descriptive statistics

```{r}
```

### Inferential statistics

```{r}
```

## Step 5: Conclusion

```{r}
```

[Please also include a brief text summary describing your findings. If this reproducibility check was a failure, you should note any suggestions as to what you think the likely cause(s) might be.]

[This function will output information about the package versions used in this report:]

```{r session_info, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
devtools::session_info()
