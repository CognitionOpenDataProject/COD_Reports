## General Instructions
This General Instructions section can be deleted in your final report.

### Commentary
Provide commentary in plain text throughout. Each stage of the munging (data tidying) and analysis process must be described.

### Quotations
Use quotations or figures from the original article, codebook, or data files themselves, to illustrate what you are attempting to reproduce. Quotations should be proceeded by the '>' symbol. For example "> This is a quote from the article" will produce:

> This is a quote from the article.

### Failure and success

In some cases the data analysis pipeline reported in the original article (and any supporting documentation) will be unclear or incomplete. In such cases, you *should not* attempt to make an educated guess about what the original authors did. Instead, you should note that there is a INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION ERROR.

Whenever you identify a potential discrepancy between an outcome from your analysis and a reported outcome, you should use the compareValues() function. This function takes three arguments: the reported outcome, the outcome obtained in your analysis and "isP". "isP" should be set to TRUE if you are comparing p-values, otherwise you do not need to specifcy anything (it will default to FALSE). The function will identify if there is a discrepancy between the reported and obtained values, classify the error type, and return a standardised reporting sentence that you should include in your report. For example:

```{}
compareValues(reportedValue = .054, obtainedValue = .049, isP = T)
```

Consult the instructions document for further details. At the end of report you should report a tally of these outcomes using the codReport() function (see end of this document for more information).
 
## Step 1: Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(knitr) # for kable table formating
library(haven) # import and export 'SPSS', 'Stata' and 'SAS' Files
library(readxl) # import excel files
```

## Step 2: Load data

```{r}
```

## Step 3: Tidy data

```{r}
```

## Step 4: Run analysis

### Pre-processing

```{r}
```

### Descriptive statistics

```{r}
```

### Inferential statistics

```{r}
```

## Step 5: Conclusion

Upon completion of your report, please tally up the number of errors and enter them into the codReport() function. For example:

```{r}
codReport(ReportType = 'pilot',
          Article_ID = 'ArticleID', 
          Insufficient_Information_Errors = 0,
          Decision_Errors = 0, 
          Major_Numerical_Errors = 0, 
          Minor_Numerical_Errors = 0)
```

Please also include a brief text summary describing your findings. If this reproducibility check was a failure, you should note any suggestions as to what you think the likely cause(s) might be.

This function will output information about the package versions used in this report:

```{r session_info, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
devtools::session_info()
```
