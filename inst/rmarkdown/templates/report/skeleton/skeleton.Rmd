## General Instructions
This General Instructions section can be deleted in your final report.

### Commentary
Provide commentary in plain text throughout. Each stage of the munging (data tidying) and analysis process must be described.

### Quotations
Use quotations or figures from the original article, codebook, or data files themselves, to illustrate what you are attempting to reproduce. Quotations should be proceeded by the '>' symbol. For example "> This is a quote from the article" will produce:

> This is a quote from the article.

### Failure and success

Whenever you compare an outcome from your analysis with a reported outcome you should note in **bold** text (using double asterix like this: "**bold**") which of the following apply:

* **OK** (i.e., no discrepancy)
* **MINOR NUMERICAL**
* **MAJOR NUMERICAL**
* **DECISION ERROR**

Consult the instructions document for further details. At the end of report you should report a tally of these outcomes.
 

## Step 1: Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(haven) # import and export 'SPSS', 'Stata' and 'SAS' Files
library(readxl) # import excel files
```

## Step 2: Load data

```{r}
```

## Step 3: Tidy data

```{r}
```

## Step 4: Run analysis

### Pre-processing

```{r}
```

### Descriptive statistics

```{r}
```

### Inferential statistics

```{r}
```

## Step 5: Conclusion

Results tally:

* **OK** (i.e., no discrepancy): ?
* **MINOR NUMERICAL ERROR**: ?
* **MAJOR NUMERICAL ERROR**: ?
* **DECISION ERROR**: ?

If there were any major numerical or decision errors then this reproducibility check was a failure. If there were only minor numerical errors, or no discrepancies, then this reproducibility check was a success.

OVERALL CONCLUSION: **SUCCESS/FAILURE**

```{r session_info, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
